# xmatch-3
 
Made this match-3 themed prototype to see if I could. There is a level editor for adjusting the map size and number of colors. Maps are saved as binary in the app permanent path. To launch this prototype, open the Scenes/Main Menu.unity and hit Play. This game also features a hint system and a powerup that pops up if you match 5 tiles.
